- questionnaire forms and statistic results have desktop and mobile version
- result application **currently packed in preserve package mode**, 4 packing configurations included in `./.packager/`
- packed with [**Packager library - mvccore/packager**](https://github.com/mvccore/packager)), all packing ways possible:
  - **PHAR file**
    - standard PHAR package with whole devel directory content
  - **PHP file**
    - **strict package**
      - everything is contained in result `index.php`
      - only `.htaccess` or `web.config` are necessary to use mod_rewrite
    - **preserve package**
      - result `index.php` file contains PHP files, 
        PHTML templates but no CSS/JS/fonts or images
      - all wrapped file system functions are looking inside 
        package first, then they try to read data from HDD
	  - currently used for packed app in result directory
    - **preserve hdd**
      - result `index.php` file contains PHP files, 
        PHTML templates but no CSS/JS/fonts or images
      - all wrapped file system functions are looking on HDD first, 
        then they try to read data from package inself
    - **strict hdd**
      - result `index.php` file contains only PHP files, 
        but PHTML templates, all CSS/JS/fonts and images are on HDD
      - no PHP file system function is wrapped
- XML files for questionnaires and their questions are excluded from index.php result package,
  to define any other questionnaires and questions in future, but rest of the application is portable, 
  it means everything else is contained in index.php result file.
